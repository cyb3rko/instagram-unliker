# instagram-unliker
Simple script for removing your Instagram likes.  
Inspired by and based on [jhnguyen521/InstaUnliker](https://github.com/jhnguyen521/InstaUnliker) 💛

## ⛔ Rate Limiting

To avoid possible blocking / banning of your account keep the number of posts to unlike at a low level.  
The [current default value](https://github.com/cyb3rko/instagram-unliker/blob/main/unliker.py#L8) worked fine for me while running this script every few hours.

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

Open the [unliker.py](unliker.py) file, configure your options at the top and let it run. :)
